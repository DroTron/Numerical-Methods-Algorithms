# Simpson.m
This MatLab R2018b program uses Simpons 1/3 rule to evaluate the integral of tabular data
of the vector function values 'y' with respect to 'x'

# I/O:
1. Inputs
   * x - spacing of data in y
   * y - function values at corresponding x
2. Outputs
   * I - the calculated value of the integral
4. Help
   * [I] = Simpson(x,y);
   
# Important Note
This program currently does not evaluate the integral properly.
