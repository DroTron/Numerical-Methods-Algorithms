# Numerical-Methods
This repository contains MATLAB numerical method programs created in MECH 105<br/>
All programs created in MATLAB R2018b

## Included Programs

#### Simpson
   * Integral of tabulated data with Simpon's 1/3 rule
   * Note: If there is an even number of intervals algorithm uses trapazoidal<br/>
   rule for last interval
   * Note: This program does not work fully
#### falsePostion
   * Root finding algorithm that uses falsePosition method
   * Working as of 3/4/2019
#### luFactor
   * Decomposes matrix into upper triangular and lower triangular
   * Working as of 3/29/2019
#### bisectionFunc
   * Estimates root using two guesses that bracket root and bisection method
   * Working as of 5/10/2019
